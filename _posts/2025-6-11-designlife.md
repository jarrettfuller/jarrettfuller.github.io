discription: "Designlife is the annual alumni publication produced by the NCSU College of Design with a circulation of ~8000. In 2025, I joined the team as creative director and lead a complete redesign of the magazine. We standardized page templates, introduced a new typographic and image system, and expanded the university branding to create a cohesive, unique design to showcase the College of Design. The design team included Lizzie Edwards, Sophia Milligan, Jimmy Rameriez Jaco, Caitlin Soboslay, and Penelli Yang."

<div class="images-right"><p>&uarr; The grid system, which we introduced on the front cover, is a visual gesture suggesting the structure of each page. We decided to expose the page structure to help reveal the design decisions of the magazine, almost as if you are seeing it being designed in real time.</p></div>

<div class="images-right"><p>&uarr; On select spreads, we broke the grid we set up, arranging images in various rotations, both to subvert the structure and to imply the feeling of a work-in-progress, as if the images haven't been placed yet or to suggest a messy desk in-project.</p></div>
