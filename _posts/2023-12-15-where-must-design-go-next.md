title: "Where Must Design Go Next?"
tags: Editing
discription: "I was honored to be awarded the Latham Fellowship at the Institute of Design (ID) at Illinois Tech for the 2022-2023 academic year. Coinciding with the school's 85th anniversary, I proposed a series of roundtable discussions and interviews about the present and future of design education, practice, and theory. The result was six roundtables with ID faculty that were turned into a podcast series, an online archive, and this book, which was published by Oro Editions in December 2023. I edited and designed the book, which is available wherever books are sold."
