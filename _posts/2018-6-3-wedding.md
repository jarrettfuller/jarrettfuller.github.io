discription: On June 3, 2018, I married my long-time girlfriend and best friend Eurry. We got married at the John James Audubon Center, the former home of the famed naturalist and bird painter. I used Audubon's famous paintings as the centerpiece for the design and built a flexible system around them ranging from invitations to nametags to decorations.

<div class="images-right"><p>&uarr; For the invitations, that went out a few months later, we started incorporating Audubon's images in a fold-out poster on the back of the invitation that collages the state birds from notable locations in our lives: where we were born, where met, where we were getting married, and where we live now. What starts as a simple black and white invite, unfolds into an 18x20 full-color poster.</p></div>
