title: "What It Means To Be A Designer Today"
tags: Editing
discription: "This book, co-edited with Liz Stinson and published by Princeton Architectural Press, featured both collected and newly commissioned essays on the state of graphic design today from AIGA's Eye on Design. Organized into three parts—Reflections, Questions, and Ideas—this book covers the most pressing issues and provocations that designers face in our current world, including the evolution of personal branding, teaching design history, the cult of minimalism, the perils of hero worship, and more. Contributors include Rick Poynor, Anne Quito, Briar Levit, Cliff Kuang, and many more. I also contributed two essays."
