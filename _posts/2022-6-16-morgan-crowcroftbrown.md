“The details are not the details,” said Charles Eames. “The details make the design.” I think Eames is saying that all the little, seemingly invisible decisions that no one else will notice, these are the things that make a piece of design work or not work. This idea is perhaps never more evident than in designing a photo book. As a long-time photography enthusiast, I’ve always found the book to be the ideal format for looking at images: it’s intimate and accessible, sequential and narrative.

I’ve collected photo books for years but, strangely, never considered their design. My interest in them was purely photographic — I was interested in the photographer or the narrative or the type of images. In the case of a photo book, this is often the marker of good design: one shouldn’t be distracted by the size of the book or the quality of the paper or the typographic choices: all of these decisions are in service of the photographs. The details make the design.

Over the last few years, I started to notice that many of my favorite photo books were designed by the same person. Morgan Crowcroft-Brown is the designer and production manager (or “production manager and designer,” she tells me. “Because I’m uncomfortable calling myself a designer”) for MACK, the London-based photography publisher. Since 2018, Crowcroft-Brown has worked on books for photographers ranging from Stephen Shore to Teju Cole, Luigi Ghirri to Deanna Templeton.

Many of the decisions Morgan makes involve these invisible details: what paper to use, the type of binding, how big the margins should be, how the photographs should be printed. If there’s a through-line through Morgan’s books, it’s a respect for materials: a clear understanding of the physicality of these objects and how they shape our reaction to them. Morgan and I spoke over Zoom recently to talk about how she negotiates these design decisions, as well as her own design education and why the details really are the design.

**How did you get into designing photo books? Is your background in design?**

No, I actually studied anthropology in Sydney, where I’m from. This feels like something I just fell into. I worked in bookshops since I was 16 and while I was getting my degree, I was managing the art department of a local bookshop. I was ordering titles and making newsletters and these kinds of things. After I finished my degree, I was doing that full time and thinking “What the hell am I doing with my life?” — as you do! I saw that MACK was hiring interns and figured there was no harm in applying.

So I applied, had a Skype interview, got the internship, and moved to London within two months. It was meant to be a three-month internship but after a month, the director, Michael Mack, hired me full-time as an assistant in the office. I did that for four or five months until, coincidentally, the designer, Lewis Chaplin, who was working here left. They didn’t hire a replacement so for the rest of the year, my colleague and I managed the design work under the direct supervision of Michael. I had no idea what I was doing. Then my colleague left and it was just me left to do everything. Now here I am four years later! That was my design education.
