<h4>CV</h4>
<article><p>My practice spans graphic design, writing, editing, journalism, and education. I’m based in Raleigh, North Carolina where I’m an assistant professor of graphic design at North Carolina State University. I’m also an editor for AIGA Eye on Design and the host of the design podcast Scratching the Surface. My research focuses on design discourse, media, and publishing, with a special interest in institutional histories, alternative practices, and critical design.</p>

<p>Since 2016, I’ve hosted and produced Scratching the Surface, a podcast about design, theory, and creative practice. On the show, I’ve interviewed a wide-range of designers, writers, academics, and artists including Pentagram partners Michael Beirut, Eddie Opara, Abbott Miller, and Michael Gericke, OMA partner Reinier de Graaf, MoMA curator Paola Antonelli, New York Times architecture critics Michael Kimmelman and Paul Goldberger, and RISD President Rosanne Somerson.</p>

<p>As a writer and editor, I've written for a variety of publications and books. Since 2020, I've been a contributing editor at AIGA Eye on Design. I was the editor of <i>1, 10, 100 Years of Form, Typography, and Interaction at Parsons</i>, published by Oro Editions in 2021, and the designer and co-editor of <i>Culture is Not Always Popular: Fifteen Years of Design Observer</i>, published by MIT Press in 2018. In 2017, I launched readings.design, a free online library of design texts. In 2021, I was the judge for the Design History Society’s Design Writing Prize.</p>

<p>With my studio, twenty-six, I’ve worked with clients large and small, all around the world, on projects ranging from visual design to editorial strategy to research initiatives. Past clients have included Thames and Hudson, MIT Press, American University in Sharjah, University of Nevada, Instagram, and Design Observer.</p>

<p>I’ve taught in both undergraduate and graduate at Pratt Institute , The New School Parsons School of Design, University of the Arts, Maryland Institute College of Art, and Rutgers University and have given lectures or presentations at Rhode Island School of Design, Kutztown University, The New School Parsons Sshool of Design, Rochester Institute of Technology, and Northampton Community College. Before moving to academia, I worked as a designer at Facebook, Warby Parker, and The Whitney Museum of American Art. I have BFA in graphic design from Kutztown University and an MFA in graphic design and critical studies from Maryland Institute College of Art.</p>

<h4>Now (updated October 3, 2021)</h4>
 <article><p>After years in Brooklyn, I recently relocated to Raleigh, NC to begin a tenure-track position at North Carolina State University. I've enjoyed many meetings, coffee chats, and lunches with faculty, students, and colleagues. We're exploring Raleigh's extensive park system and I'm enjoying riding my new bike. In the midst of this, I'm trying to find time to continue writing.</p>

<p>I'm thinking a lot about the intersection of administration and scholarship, the role of design in shaping institutions, and beginning a big research project on an intellectual history of graphic design. I'm spending a lot of time in the archives here understanding the history of the College of Design. I may have a book proposal or two in the works.</p>

    <h4>About this Site</h4>
        <article>
            <p>I'm a believer in making work open source so this site is built entirely with open-source and free tools. The site uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, an open-source, static-site generator, and is hosted <a href="https://github.com/jarrettfuller/jarrettfuller.github.io">on Github</a>. It’s set in <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla">Karla</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tinos">Tinos</a> and served up via Google Fonts. You are free to adapt, remix, reuse, and update both the code and visual design for your own needs. That said, if you do use the code for your own site, please include a credit and link back here. Thanks!</p>

            <p>I live and work on land originally inhabited by two Indigenous tribes: the Tuscarora and the Catawba tribes. I honor these tribes by recognizing I'm on stolen land and honor them today to break the cycle of colonization.</p>
