<h4>Now (updated October 3, 2021)</h4>
 <article><p>After years in Brooklyn, I recently relocated to Raleigh, NC to begin a tenure-track position at North Carolina State University. I've enjoyed many meetings, coffee chats, and lunches with faculty, students, and colleagues. We're exploring Raleigh's extensive park system and I'm enjoying riding my new bike. In the midst of this, I'm trying to find time to continue writing.</p>

<p>I'm thinking a lot about the intersection of administration and scholarship, the role of design in shaping institutions, and beginning a big research project on an intellectual history of graphic design. I'm spending a lot of time in the archives here understanding the history of the College of Design. I may have a book proposal or two in the works.</p>

    <h4>About this Site</h4>
        <article>
            <p>I'm a believer in making work open source so this site is built entirely with open-source and free tools. The site uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, an open-source, static-site generator, and is hosted <a href="https://github.com/jarrettfuller/jarrettfuller.github.io">on Github</a>. It’s set in <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla">Karla</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tinos">Tinos</a> and served up via Google Fonts. You are free to adapt, remix, reuse, and update both the code and visual design for your own needs. That said, if you do use the code for your own site, please include a credit and link back here. Thanks!</p>

            <p>I live and work on land originally inhabited by two Indigenous tribes: the Tuscarora and the Catawba tribes. I honor these tribes by recognizing I'm on stolen land and honor them today to break the cycle of colonization.</p>
