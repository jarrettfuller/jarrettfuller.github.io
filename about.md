<h4>Now</h4>
<article><p>My professional practice spans graphic design, writing, editing, journalism, and education. I’m based in Raleigh, North Carolina where I’m an assistant professor and the director of undergraduate programs in Graphic and Experience Design at North Carolina State University. I’m also the host of the design podcast Scratching the Surface. I'm especially interested in design discourse, media infrastructures, experimental publishing, institutional histories, and alternative practices.</p>

<p>I've worked for nearly twenty years as a graphic designer, focusing on books, brands, and websites, most recently with my independent studio, <a href="http://www.twenty-six.design">twenty-six</a>. Before that, I worked as a at Facebook, Warby Parker, and The Whitney Museum of American Art. I try to take on 2-3 projects a year. If you're interested in working, let me know! </p>

<p>Increasingly, I work as a writer and editor. I've written for a variety of publications and books, and from July 2020 to November 2022, I was a contributing editor at <a href="http://eyeondesign.aiga.org"><i>AIGA Eye on Design</i></a>. I am also the editor or co-editor of four books including <i>What It Means To Be a Designer Today</i> (co-edited with Liz Stinson), <i>Where Must Design Go Next?</i>,  <i>1, 10, 100 Years of Form, Typography, and Interaction at Parsons</i>, and <i>Culture is Not Always Popular</i> (co-edited with Michael Bierut and Jessica Helfand). </p>

<p>Since 2016, I’ve hosted and produced <a href="http://www.scratchingthesurface.fm">Scratching the Surface</a>, a podcast about design, theory, and creative practice. On the show, I’ve interviewed over 200 designers, writers, academics, and artists. In 2023, I launched a companion online publishing platform, <a href="http://www.scratchingthesurface.fm/stories">Scratch</a>, where we publish experimental, interdisciplinary writing on design in the widest sense.</p>

<p>I’ve taught in both undergraduate and graduate at Pratt Institute , The New School Parsons School of Design, University of the Arts, Maryland Institute College of Art, and Rutgers University.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I'm passionate about photography, reading, watching movies, gardening, cooking, poetry, and learning to play piano.</p>

    <h4>About this Site</h4>
        <article>
            <p>I'm a believer in making work open source so this site is built entirely with open-source and free tools. The site uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, an open-source, static-site generator, and is hosted <a href="https://github.com/jarrettfuller/jarrettfuller.github.io">on Github</a>. It’s set in <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla">Karla</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tinos">Tinos</a> and served up via Google Fonts. You are free to adapt, remix, reuse, and update both the code and visual design for your own needs. That said, if you do use the code for your own site, please include a credit and link back here. Thanks!</p>

            <p>I <a href="/about/studio">live and work</a> on land originally inhabited by two Indigenous tribes: the Tuscarora and the Catawba tribes. I honor these tribes by recognizing I'm on stolen land and honor them today to break the cycle of colonization.</p>
